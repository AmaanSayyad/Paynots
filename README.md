# Motivation

- Ukraine Monobank‚Äôs ‚ÄúJar‚Äù inspired the idea of simple, purpose-based money flows.

- Users could create goal-based virtual accounts (jars) to collect money with custom logic (e.g. round-ups, % of expenses, recurring transfers).

- Became extremely popular among Ukrainian volunteers and civilians for fundraising during the Russia-Ukraine war. (piggy banks)

- Showed the power of purpose-driven money flows that are simple and shareable.

- Paynotes brings crypto payments closer to how modern individuals operate online.


# The Problem

- Managing PAYOUT streams is chaotic, no simplified way to setup the AUTOPAY, SPLIT BILLS AND GENERATE QR CODES

- Absence of GAMIFICATION, GOAL ACHIEVEMENT rewards

- Absence of TOP-UP JARS and EASY DROP AND DRAG FUNCTIONALITY 

- Absence of AA and simplified onboarding


# The Solution

Paynots introduces programmable, purpose-driven money flows.

- Users can create flows just like ‚Äújars‚Äù to organize, automate, and track incoming and outgoing crypto payments. 

- Users can set up autopay, split payments to multiple wallets, and generate trackable QR codes or links instantly. Gamification and milestones make saving or fundraising fun and rewarding.

- Visual progress bars, social sharing, and unlockable rewards keep users engaged and motivated.

- Top-up jars and drag-and-drop flow manaagement bring intuitive UX to Web3.

- Users can fund jars manually, schedule recurring top-ups, and easily reorder or prioritize flows.

- Account Abstraction and one-click onboarding remove Web3 friction.
